Scoot(34) player-card generation (`tools/player-cards/`, Modal + ComfyUI,
SDXL `animagine-xl-4.0`) is deployed and stable — cel-shaded style is
solved and locked. Facial likeness is not: 10 real identity-preservation
combinations (IP-Adapter FaceID, PuLID weight/method sweep, dedicated
face crop, a hand-built face-detailer compositing pass) all plateaued at
"real facial features, not confidently recognizable as the subject."

**Why:** researched via Perplexity (2026-08-18) — PuLID/FaceID were
trained with cross-attention layers calibrated against frozen base
SDXL/SDXL-Lightning. Animagine XL 4.0 is a full-parameter finetune far
from that distribution, so the adapters fight the checkpoint. This is a
documented, citable mechanism (PuLID's own paper), not bad luck or bad
tuning.

**Also found:** the InsightFace models underlying the current PuLID/
FaceID pipeline (`buffalo_l`, `antelopev2`, `inswapper_128`) are licensed
non-commercial-research-only — a real constraint on the deployed
pipeline today, independent of the likeness question. Needs a decision
on whether Scoot(34) cards count as commercial use.

**Where to pick this up:**
- `tools/player-cards/FACIAL_LIKENESS_RESEARCH.md` — full research,
  sourced, with an explicit evidence-gaps section.
- `tools/player-cards/PLAN_facial_likeness.md` — prioritized plan, not
  yet executed. Tier 1 (cheap, ~1 afternoon): re-run the identical PuLID
  test on Animagine XL 4.0 "Zero" instead of "Opt" — Zero is the
  pretraining-stage checkpoint the adapters are actually closer to.
  Tier 2 (the real fix, ~1-2 weeks): per-subject LoRA training on Zero,
  ~$2-9/subject on Modal (~$170-300 for the full 34-member roster,
  one-time per edition) — the only approach with a clear mechanism for
  not fighting the checkpoint, and sidesteps the licensing issue too.
  Tier 3 (bigger, only if Tier 2 is unacceptable): USO on FLUX.
- See [[scoot_currency_ledger]] and [[project_plan]] for where this sits
  relative to the main Phase 5 ledger work — player-cards is a parallel
  track, not blocking Phase 5b.
